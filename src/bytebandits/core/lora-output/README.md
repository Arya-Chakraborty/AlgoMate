# Model Weights Setup

This directory should contain the fine-tuned LoRA weights for the model.

## Getting Started

1. Download the pre-trained weights and place them in this directory.
2. The weights should include at least these files:
   - adapter_model.bin
   - adapter_config.json

## Training Your Own Weights

To train your own weights, use the training script in the `training` directory.
